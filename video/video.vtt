00:00.330 --> 00:01.590
Everyone welcome back.

00:01.800 --> 00:06.820
So this section is a continuation or it accompanies a previous section they're meant to go together.

00:06.870 --> 00:09.690
So if you didn't watch that one I'd definitely recommend you start there.

00:09.690 --> 00:13.860
I say that about pretty much everything but in particular these two go hand-in-hand.

00:13.860 --> 00:18.030
So we're still talking about algorithms difficult problems to solve.

00:18.030 --> 00:21.990
How do you even approach a difficult problem how do you get better at solving them whether it's in an

00:21.990 --> 00:24.770
interview or on a side project to working on.

00:25.110 --> 00:30.630
So we talked about sort of two different steps or two things devising a plan for solving problems before

00:30.630 --> 00:31.790
you write a line of code.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.920
How do you even approach a new problem something that's real.

00:35.010 --> 00:36.400
Real head scratcher.

00:36.540 --> 00:40.340
And then the second thing is mastering common problem solving patterns.

00:40.350 --> 00:44.670
So the last section was devoted to that first point to make that clear.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.040
Lovely green color.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.230
So we're done with that.

00:47.250 --> 00:48.540
We talked about an approach.

00:48.570 --> 00:53.530
Now we're going to talk about some common patterns that sometimes can come in handy.

00:53.730 --> 00:58.490
And I want to say that this section can be a bit of a letdown this material.

00:58.530 --> 01:05.070
I've seen a lot of students sort of get disappointed because they built it up as some sort of cure all

01:05.280 --> 01:08.400
little notebook of patterns that they need to memorize.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.020
And then every problem they ever face every interview challenge every face.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.920
They'll know exactly what to do and that's not the case at all.

01:14.940 --> 01:20.400
In reality there are some common patterns that we'll discuss that do apply to multiple problems.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.560
There are common approaches to writing code sort of archetypes or problem but that does not mean that

01:25.560 --> 01:28.270
you cover every possible scenario on earth.

01:28.380 --> 01:30.880
So it might help you in one out of five.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.250
One out of 10 challenges you have to face.

01:33.360 --> 01:38.190
But even if it's only 1 out of 10 that's still helpful and worth knowing.

01:38.220 --> 01:42.090
So there are lots of these patterns and some of them have names that are official.

01:42.090 --> 01:45.120
Some of them have not official but names that are recognized.

01:45.120 --> 01:49.720
Other people like divide and conquer for example or greedy algorithms.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.390
But some of them are things that aren't necessarily well-known names.

01:54.390 --> 01:59.700
The concept might be well-known but if you tried to google something like frequency counter as far as

01:59.700 --> 02:06.080
I know you'll probably find more results about a detector for counting the frequency of a sound or a

02:06.080 --> 02:07.170
wave form or something.

02:07.240 --> 02:08.620
That's what that is.

02:08.640 --> 02:13.290
So some of these aren't really official terminology but all of these are different approaches different

02:13.290 --> 02:15.120
patterns for writing code.

02:15.180 --> 02:18.470
And when I say pattern I think that can get a little confusing.

02:18.570 --> 02:23.840
I like to think of them as sort of programming mechanisms different pieces that you can put in or or

02:24.040 --> 02:25.310
through a blueprint.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.000
I think I've said that a couple of times.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.260
So we're going to start off with a frequency counter.

02:29.280 --> 02:33.740
We're not going to cover all of these in this one section but we're going to cover a couple of them.

02:33.750 --> 02:39.120
And the way it will work is I'll introduce the idea explain it and then do an example where I show you

02:39.840 --> 02:41.940
sort of a poorly written solution to a problem.

02:42.030 --> 02:46.470
The naive approach and then the approach using the pattern that I'm introducing and then I'm going to

02:46.470 --> 02:51.030
try and give you as many opportunities to practice on your own with exercises and solutions and that

02:51.030 --> 02:51.690
sort of thing.

02:51.690 --> 02:55.860
So first up we're going to talk about the frequency counter pattern that's coming up next.
